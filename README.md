## 🚀 What is CosmicMatch?

CosmicMatch is a web app where users take on the role of either a **star** or a **planet**, and interact with data-driven celestial companions. Each planet or star has its own personality, crafted using real NASA exoplanet data — turning cold space facts into warm cosmic stories.

It’s fun. It’s educational. And it’s probably the only place where a gas giant can roast you for being too clingy.
